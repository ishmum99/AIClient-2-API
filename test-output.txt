PASS tests/request-queue.test.js (5.346 s)
  RequestQueue
    √ runs tasks one at a time — no overlap (165 ms)
    √ return value propagates to the caller (2 ms)
    √ errors propagate to the caller and queue continues (2 ms)
    √ getStatus reports correct counts (55 ms)
    √ handles many concurrent enqueues in FIFO order (6 ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       5 passed, 5 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        5.688 s
Ran all test suites matching /.\\tests\\request-queue.test.js/i.
Force exiting Jest: Have you considered using `--detectOpenHandles` to detect async operations that kept running after all tests finished?
